# Cartel_detection

This group project relates to the course Economics in Practice at the University of St. Gallen.

We were given a data set of tender bids for various projects over time for three given industries and were asked to detect collusive bid rigging behvaiour. Using behavioural screening methods and a pre-trained machine learning model, we discovered that some of the bids seemed collusive and were likely to be part of a cartel.

Methods used for the analysis include economic theory, descriptive data analysis of summary statistics, and applying a machine learing model developed in Huber, Imhof (2019): Machine learning with screens for detecting bid-rigging cartels.

Note that the final text document and presentation slides are not included in this repository.
